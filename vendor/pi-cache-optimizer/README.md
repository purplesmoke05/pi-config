[中文说明](./README.zh-CN.md)

Pi extension for improving provider-side KV / prompt cache hit rates. It keeps stable prompt content near the front, adds a conservative OpenAI-compatible `prompt_cache_key` fallback, warns about common proxy cache-routing gaps, and shows read-only footer cache stats.

> Renamed from `pi-deepseek-cache-optimizer`. Existing footer counters migrate automatically. The extension does **not** touch Pi's `models.json` during normal operation (default: `~/.pi/agent/models.json`; custom agent dirs use `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`); only `/cache-optimizer fix` can edit it, and only after an explicit interactive preview + confirmation with an automatic timestamped backup.

## What it does

- Reorders uniquely identifiable stable system-prompt content before dynamic context. If the same candidate appears more than once (for example, quoted inside dynamic context), it is left unchanged to avoid removing the wrong occurrence.
- Compresses Pi skill listings and strips session-overview churn.
- Requests long cache retention when Pi/provider compat supports it.
- Adds a session-id `prompt_cache_key` fallback for `openai-completions` / `openai-responses` payloads when no effective key exists, including Pi's built-in `llama.cpp` provider as Pi 0.82+ core does.
- Warns once for third-party OpenAI-compatible proxies missing cache/session-affinity compat flags.
- Detects adaptive-thinking compat for Claude (opus-4.6+ including Opus 5, sonnet-4.6+ including Sonnet 5, fable-5+) and Kimi Coding K3 / `kimi-for-coding` custom channels.
- Shows daily cumulative provider/model footer stats by default, with an opt-in current-session display mode.
- Supports optional router-extension integration through versioned global protocols (`Symbol.for("pi.routing.registry.v1")` and `Symbol.for("pi.cache.hints.v1")`) without importing router packages.

Caching is provider-side and best-effort. Third-party proxies and router extensions can still hide cache usage, reject unsupported parameters, or route requests across multiple upstreams.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-cache-optimizer
```

If you previously installed the old package:

```bash
pi remove npm:pi-deepseek-cache-optimizer && pi install npm:pi-cache-optimizer
```

Run `/reload` in Pi after install/update/remove so extension hooks refresh.

On Pi 0.79.7 and newer, `pi update` updates Pi itself only. To update installed Pi packages such as this extension, run `pi update --extensions` (packages only) or `pi update --all` (Pi + packages).

This extension is validated against Pi 0.84.1 and remains designed for Pi 0.82+. It uses the existing extension hooks, `getAgentDir()`, and prompt options shared by those versions; it does not depend on Pi 0.83+ APIs such as `ctx.scopedModels` or the bundled TypeBox 1.3 aliases.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/cache-optimizer` | Interactive menu when UI supports it; otherwise prints help and current state. |
| `/cache-optimizer enable` | Enables runtime optimizations for the current Pi process, resets local footer stats, and starts a fresh “enabled” measurement. |
| `/cache-optimizer disable` | Disables optimization for the current Pi process, resets local footer stats, and keeps collecting footer stats in disabled comparison mode. Run `/reload` or restart Pi to return to startup behavior. |
| `/cache-optimizer doctor` | Shows active model/provider/API/base URL/compat plus low-hit diagnosis. |
| `/cache-optimizer compat` | Shows copyable compat advice for the active model, if applicable. |
| `/cache-optimizer stats` | Shows today's local provider/model counters and recent trend for the active model. |
| `/cache-optimizer reset` | Resets local footer stats for the active provider/model; upstream provider cache is not modified. |
| `/cache-optimizer config footer-mode total\|session\|process` | Persist the footer stats mode. Persistent command configuration overrides the environment variable. |
| `/cache-optimizer fix` | Auto-repairs safe compat issues for the active model (adaptive thinking, DeepSeek reasoning, OpenAI proxy session affinity). Shows preview + risk warning, requires confirmation. **Only modifies `models.json` after explicit user approval.** |

`/cache-optimizer` uses Pi's native Tab completion. Type `/cache-optimizer <Tab>` for the supported subcommands, `/cache-optimizer c<Tab>` for `config`, `/cache-optimizer config <Tab>` for `footer-mode`, and `/cache-optimizer config footer-mode <Tab>` for `total`, `session`, or `process`. Suggestions are prefix-filtered and invalid prefixes are left to Pi's normal fallback behavior.

The interactive `/cache-optimizer` menu includes `Footer mode`, where you can choose `total`, `session`, or `process`. `enable` / `disable` are current-process switches. For a persistent opt-out, use environment variables below.

## Persistent opt-out

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PI_CACHE_OPTIMIZER_NO_PROMPT_REWRITE=1` | Disable prompt mutations only; footer stats and cache-key fallback remain active. |
| `PI_CACHE_OPTIMIZER_NO_SKILL_COMPRESSION=1` | Keep Pi's verbose skill XML. |
| `PI_CACHE_OPTIMIZER_NO_OPENAI_CACHE_KEY=1` | Disable the OpenAI-compatible `prompt_cache_key` fallback. Preferred explicit opt-out. |
| `PI_CACHE_OPTIMIZER_OPENAI_CACHE_KEY=0` | Disable the same fallback via the legacy inverse switch. Values `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` disable it. |

## Footer cache stats mode

**v2.7.0+** supports daily cumulative and conversation-session footer scopes. **v2.7.1** adds the Footer mode option to the interactive `/cache-optimizer` menu. **v2.8.0+** also supports process-scoped counters. The footer defaults to `total`, which shows the provider/model's local counters for the current day across Pi sessions and process restarts. Use either the command or environment variable to select the scope:

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `total` (default) | Show today's restart-persistent provider/model totals across sessions. Local day rollover resets the counters. |
| `session` | Show only the current hashed Pi conversation session's counters. A fresh conversation session starts at `0/0`; restarting Pi while resuming the same session restores that session bucket. |

| `process` | Show only counters collected by the current Pi process. It starts at `0/0` after Pi restart or extension reload and is never restored from disk. |

Persistent command configuration takes precedence over the environment variable:

```text
/cache-optimizer config footer-mode total
/cache-optimizer config footer-mode session
/cache-optimizer config footer-mode process
```

The explicit setting is stored in `pi-cache-optimizer-config.json` under Pi's agent directory. If no command override exists, `PI_CACHE_OPTIMIZER_FOOTER_MODE=total|session|process` is used; values are case-insensitive, and missing or invalid values fall back to `total`. To return an existing installation to environment-controlled behavior, manually delete `pi-cache-optimizer-config.json` and run `/reload`.

## OpenAI-compatible proxy setup

Third-party `openai-completions` proxies (LiteLLM / OneAPI / NewAPI / OpenRouter-like channels) often route one session across multiple upstream backends. That splits provider-side prompt caches.

Pi 0.84.1 also fixes built-in Fireworks compatibility for models that reject `prompt_cache_retention`; keep the extension's diagnostics focused on the effective model compat exposed by Pi rather than adding a provider-name special case. Pi 0.81+ also has a built-in `llama.cpp` provider using an OpenAI-shaped transport. Pi 0.82+ core generates a session `prompt_cache_key` for it when cache retention is enabled, so this extension preserves that key and may add the same conservative fallback when missing. The built-in provider's explicit compat fingerprint is excluded from generic proxy routing/session-affinity advice, but a custom or overridden provider that merely reuses the id `llama.cpp` is treated like any other OpenAI-compatible channel. `prompt_cache_retention` remains subject to the normal safety rule: keep it only for official OpenAI or an explicit effective `supportsLongCacheRetention: true` opt-in in `models.json`; otherwise strip it before sending. Effective values follow Pi's precedence: `modelOverrides[modelId].compat` first, then the matching `models[].compat`, then provider-level `compat`. An explicit `false` at a higher layer overrides `true` below it.

For real proxies, start with session affinity:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-provider-id": {
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "baseUrl": "https://example.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "env:YOUR_API_KEY",
      "compat": {
        "sendSessionAffinityHeaders": true
      },
      "models": [
        { "id": "gpt-5.5", "name": "GPT-5.5" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `sendSessionAffinityHeaders: true` is the safe default when your proxy supports sticky routing.
- `supportsLongCacheRetention: true` is optional. Add it only when the endpoint explicitly supports OpenAI long prompt cache retention.
- If you see `400 Unsupported parameter: prompt_cache_retention`, remove/avoid `supportsLongCacheRetention` for that channel. Keep `sendSessionAffinityHeaders` if supported.
- Use `/cache-optimizer compat` or `/cache-optimizer doctor` to see model-specific advice.
- For DeepSeek models, the Pi Mono guidance expects `compat.requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages: true` and `compat.thinkingFormat: "deepseek"` alongside cache/session-affinity flags when the endpoint supports them.
- This extension's `doctor` and `compat` commands only advise; they do not modify `models.json`.

## Anthropic cache TTL compatibility

Anthropic processes cache breakpoints in `tools → system → messages` order and rejects a `ttl: "1h"` breakpoint that appears after a 5-minute breakpoint. An ephemeral `cache_control` without `ttl` uses the default 5-minute retention.

For every `anthropic-messages` channel, the extension checks the final serialized payload and immediately downgrades a visibly invalid short-to-long transition. Legal long-only and `1h → 5m` payloads remain unchanged, including third-party endpoints that genuinely support 1-hour retention.

Some proxies rewrite or insert hidden 5-minute breakpoints after Pi's request hook. If a provider returns Anthropic's explicit TTL-ordering error, the extension records a process-local provider/model fallback so the next subsequent request uses the default 5-minute TTL. This error is a non-retryable HTTP 400 in Pi 0.82.1, so the extension does not claim that Pi's automatic retry will rerun the failed turn; if another layer retries it, that retry also uses the fallback. `/cache-optimizer doctor` reports the fallback and `/cache-optimizer fix` can persist a model-scoped `supportsLongCacheRetention: false` with the normal confirmation/backup flow. Other 400 errors and prompt-too-long failures do not activate this fallback. The runtime observation lasts until the current process exits and survives extension reloads within that process.

## Adaptive thinking models

Claude models from opus-4.6 / sonnet-4.6 (including Opus 5 and Sonnet 5) / fable-5 onwards require `forceAdaptiveThinking: true` in compat. Kimi Coding K3 (`k3`) and `kimi-for-coding` also use adaptive thinking and need `allowEmptySignature: true` so replayed empty-signature thinking blocks remain valid. Without the required compat, Pi may send a legacy thinking payload or replay thinking incorrectly. Pi 0.83+ native Opus 5 catalogs are covered by the same adaptive-thinking detection; custom `anthropic-messages` channels still need the compat flag when Pi does not provide it.

Pi's built-in catalog already sets this flag for official models. Custom channels in `models.json` that override these models must include the flag:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-claude-channel": {
      "api": "anthropic-messages",
      "baseUrl": "https://...",
      "apiKey": "env:YOUR_KEY",
      "compat": {
        "forceAdaptiveThinking": true
      },
      "models": [
        { "id": "claude-sonnet-5", "name": "Claude Sonnet 5" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use model-level override:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-claude-channel": {
      "modelOverrides": {
        "claude-sonnet-5": {
          "compat": {
            "forceAdaptiveThinking": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Kimi Coding K3 custom channels, use model-level compat when the provider contains mixed models:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-kimi-coding-channel": {
      "modelOverrides": {
        "k3": {
          "compat": {
            "forceAdaptiveThinking": true,
            "allowEmptySignature": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Pi 0.80.9+ already includes Kimi K3 in built-in Kimi Coding, Moonshot AI / China, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway catalogs. The Moonshot/OpenRouter variants use their OpenAI-compatible transport and continue through the normal Kimi footer/proxy path; the adaptive compat above applies only to `anthropic-messages` Kimi Coding channels.

`/cache-optimizer doctor` and `/cache-optimizer compat` detect missing flags and show copyable JSON.

## Auto-repair with `/cache-optimizer fix`

**v2.6.0+** adds a `fix` subcommand that can auto-repair safe compat issues:

- Adaptive thinking (`forceAdaptiveThinking: true`; Kimi Coding K3 / `kimi-for-coding` also `allowEmptySignature: true`)
- DeepSeek Pi Mono reasoning compat (`thinkingFormat: "deepseek"`, `requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages: true`)
- OpenAI-compatible proxy session affinity (`sendSessionAffinityHeaders: true` for `openai-completions`). Pi 0.80.7+ controls `openai-responses` header shape with `sessionAffinityFormat` and auto-detects its default; this extension no longer writes the removed `sendSessionIdHeader` field.

**Scope:** only the currently active model. Other channels require switching models and running `fix` again.

**Safety:**

1. Shows full preview of changes (file path, edit location, JSON to write, risks)
2. Warns: ① changes affect all sessions using that channel, ② automatic backup created at `models.json.backup-cache-optimizer-<timestamp>`, ③ Pi reload required
3. Uses comment-preserving surgical editor — existing comments, indentation, and existing key order are preserved
4. Requires explicit user confirmation (interactive prompt or `ui.select`)
5. Writes atomically (temp + rename); self-validates after write
6. Falls back to manual guidance if JSONC scanner cannot confidently locate the target

Existing `modelOverrides[modelId]` entries have Pi's highest precedence, so `fix` repairs them directly. For built-in or API-login models without a custom `models[]` entry, `fix` creates a compat-only `modelOverrides` entry instead of inventing a custom model definition. Self-validation checks the effective three-layer compat result, so a lower-level edit shadowed by an override is rejected.

**Non-interactive mode:** refuses to write; shows manual edit guidance instead.

**Run:** `/cache-optimizer fix` when the active model has detected compat issues. The command shows "nothing to fix" when compat is already complete.

### Channels without a `models.json` provider entry

Some Pi channels may be available even when there is no provider block in Pi's agent `models.json` yet (default: `~/.pi/agent/models.json`; with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, use `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/models.json`). Keep existing authentication as-is and do not copy credentials, tokens, or API keys. Add only cache/routing compatibility overrides in `models.json`.

Provider-level minimal override:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-provider-id": {
      "compat": {
        "sendSessionAffinityHeaders": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If only one model should change, use `modelOverrides`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "your-provider-id": {
      "modelOverrides": {
        "gpt-5.5": {
          "compat": {
            "sendSessionAffinityHeaders": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Footer stats

Stats are read-only local counters stored in Pi's agent directory (default: `~/.pi/agent/pi-cache-optimizer-stats.json`; custom agent dirs use `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`). Both today's provider/model totals and hashed session buckets are maintained. The footer shows daily totals by default, the conversation-session bucket in `session` mode, or the in-memory process bucket in `process` mode. The stats file contains only dates and numeric counters — no API keys, prompts, payloads, headers, responses, or model output. Footer mode configuration is stored separately in `pi-cache-optimizer-config.json`. Process-mode counters are memory-only and are intentionally absent from that file.

Pi 0.79+ also includes a built-in footer `CH` marker for the latest prompt cache hit rate. This extension complements that marker with persisted provider/model counters plus proxy compat diagnostics.

Example footer:

```text
· OpenAI cache 3/10·0.002M/0.005M 40.0% ⚠️ compat
```

The leading `· ` is owned by this extension and separates its status from statuses published by other extensions in the same footer. It is present for normal, disabled, router-restored, and warning-suffixed statuses. The compact footer format is `<label> <hit requests>/<total requests>·<cached input tokens>/<total input tokens> <token hit rate>`; token hit rate keeps one decimal place and the footer omits the redundant `tok` suffix. `/cache-optimizer stats` output is unchanged. Some adapters may also append `·write <tokens>`, and runtime diagnostics may append `⚠️ compat` or `⚠️ integrity`.

Supported footer labels include: DS, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, GLM, MiniMax, Mimo, Hunyuan, Mistral, Grok, Llama, Nemotron, Cohere, Yi, Doubao, ERNIE, Baichuan, StepFun, Spark, InternLM, Gemma, Phi, Jamba, Solar, Sonar, Nova, Reka, Falcon, DBRX, MPT, StableLM, Aquila, EXAONE, HyperCLOVA, Luminous, Hermes, Granite, Arctic, Pangu, SenseNova, Zhinao, MiniCPM, XVERSE, Orion, OpenChat, Vicuna, Wizard, Zephyr, Dolphin, OpenOrca, Starling, BLOOM, RWKV, and Aya.

Adapter selection uses only model id/name (plus assistant message model/name on message end). Generic OpenAI-shaped APIs are not treated as OpenAI-family unless the model id/name matches a supported family.

## For router / virtual-channel extension authors

If your Pi extension provides a virtual routing provider (for example `router/auto`, `router/smart`, or a profile/channel that forwards to a real upstream), this extension can show cache stats for the real upstream provider/model instead of the virtual shell. Integration is optional, versioned, and does **not** require importing this package.

### Minimum integration: final assistant message metadata

For seamless final cache-stat attribution, relay the real upstream identity on completed assistant messages:

```ts
{
  role: "assistant",
  provider: "anthropic",              // real upstream provider
  responseModel: "claude-opus-4-8",   // or model: "..."
  api: "anthropic-messages",          // upstream Pi API id when known
  usage: {
    input: 1200,       // Pi-normalized uncached input tokens, if available
    cacheRead: 8000,   // tokens read from provider prompt cache
    cacheWrite: 500,   // tokens newly written to provider prompt cache
  },
}
```

`message_end` treats these assistant-message fields as authoritative. If `provider` + `model`/`responseModel` + cache usage are present, stats update the upstream bucket even when the active model is still `router/auto`. If upstream usage does not expose cache fields, leave them absent/zero; this extension will not fake cache hits.

### Optional: live route registry for pre-response UX

Final message metadata is enough for post-response stats. For pre-response flows — footer display before the first response, `/cache-optimizer doctor`, `/cache-optimizer compat`, `/cache-optimizer reset`, and OpenAI-compatible `prompt_cache_key` fallback — register a live route adapter under `Symbol.for("pi.routing.registry.v1")`.

Protocol shape:

```ts
type PiRouteSnapshot = {
  virtualProvider: string;
  virtualModelId: string;
  provider: string;
  modelId: string;
  api?: string;
  canonicalModelId?: string;
  routeLabel?: string;
  status?: "planned" | "trying" | "selected" | "success" | "failed";
  sessionIdHash?: string;
  requestId?: string;
  timestamp: number;
};

type PiRouterAdapterV1 = {
  virtualProvider: string;
  resolveActiveRoute(
    virtualModelId: string,
    hint?: { sessionIdHash?: string; requestId?: string },
  ): PiRouteSnapshot | undefined;
  resolveCandidateRoutes?(virtualModelId: string): PiRouteSnapshot[];
  subscribe?(listener: (event: PiRouteSnapshot) => void): () => void;
};
```

Registration pattern:

```ts
const ROUTING = Symbol.for("pi.routing.registry.v1");
const registry = (globalThis as Record<symbol, unknown>)[ROUTING] as
  | { version: 1; registerRouter(adapter: PiRouterAdapterV1): () => void }
  | undefined;

registry?.registerRouter({
  virtualProvider: "router",
  resolveActiveRoute(virtualModelId, hint) {
    return {
      virtualProvider: "router",
      virtualModelId,
      provider: "deepseek",
      modelId: "deepseek-v4",
      api: "openai-completions",
      sessionIdHash: hint?.sessionIdHash,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    };
  },
});
```

Do not overwrite an existing registry. If your extension loads before this optimizer, retry registration on `session_start` or create the same V1 registry shape only if no registry exists.

### Optional: query-scoped cache hints

Routers that forward to an inner Pi request path can read query-scoped hints from `Symbol.for("pi.cache.hints.v1")`:

```ts
const CACHE_HINTS = Symbol.for("pi.cache.hints.v1");
const hints = (globalThis as Record<symbol, any>)[CACHE_HINTS]?.getHints?.({
  sessionIdHash,
  virtualProvider: "router",
  virtualModelId: "auto",
  upstreamProvider: "deepseek",
  upstreamModelId: "deepseek-v4",
  api: "openai-completions",
});
```

When the query matches the current session/route, `hints` may contain `systemPrompt`, `promptCacheKey`, and `cacheRetention: "long"`. Treat these as advisory and sensitive: do not log them, do not expose prompt text, and do not overwrite an existing request-level `prompt_cache_key` / `promptCacheKey`.

### Security and correctness rules

- Do not import `pi-cache-optimizer`; use `Symbol.for(...)` discovery only.
- Do not expose API keys, prompts, payloads, headers, response bodies, or model output in route snapshots or logs.
- Use assistant-message metadata for final attribution; live registry data is advisory and may be stale by response time.
- Preserve truthful usage. Missing cache usage should show as 0/under-reported, not as synthetic hits.

## Uninstall

```bash
pi remove npm:pi-cache-optimizer
```

Then run `/reload` or restart Pi. Optional local state cleanup (if you use `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, delete the same files from that directory instead):

| Platform | Delete local state files |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS / WSL | `rm -f ~/.pi/agent/pi-cache-optimizer-stats.json ~/.pi/agent/pi-cache-optimizer-config.json ~/.pi/agent/deepseek-cache-optimizer-stats.json` |
| Windows PowerShell | `Remove-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.pi\agent\pi-cache-optimizer-stats.json", "$env:USERPROFILE\.pi\agent\pi-cache-optimizer-config.json", "$env:USERPROFILE\.pi\agent\deepseek-cache-optimizer-stats.json" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` |
| Windows Command Prompt | `del /f /q "%USERPROFILE%\.pi\agent\pi-cache-optimizer-stats.json" "%USERPROFILE%\.pi\agent\pi-cache-optimizer-config.json" "%USERPROFILE%\.pi\agent\deepseek-cache-optimizer-stats.json" 2>nul` |

Do not delete `models.json` during cleanup; it contains your Pi model/provider configuration and is not owned by this package.

## Verify effect

1. Select a model whose provider exposes cache usage.
2. Send several similar turns in the same Pi session.
3. Watch the footer or run `/cache-optimizer stats`.
4. For third-party proxies, also run `/cache-optimizer doctor` and confirm sticky routing / session affinity on the proxy side.
